    <h2>More About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. 
        There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. 
        I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; 
        I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning,
         I like to see the moonlight at night.</p>
         <p> I like to feel the music flowing on my face, 
         I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the 
         sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the 
         middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn,
          and snow in winter. I like to sleep early.</p>
          <h3>My skill:</h3> React, JavaScript, Html, CSS, Basics of data structures and algoriths <br/><br>
            <b>THANK YOU</b></p>
